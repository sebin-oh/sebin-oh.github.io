        <p>On May 2, 2024, Sebin Oh passed his PhD Qualifying Exam.<br><br>
            Sebin Oh took his PhD Qualifying Exam and passed, and he advanced to a PhD Candidate.
            The examination committee included Prof. Matthew DeJong (Chair), Prof. Sanjay Govindjee, Prof. Kenichi Soga, and Prof. Marta Gonzalez.
            The Qualifying Exam was composed of 2 phases: (1) Research presentation and (2) Course-related Q&A.
            He gave a presentation about his PhD study titled <em>Multi-Scale Regional Risk Assessment of Civil Infrastructures Using Statistical Physics</em>. The presentation was about 30 minutes, followed by about 30 minutes of Q&A.
            In the second part of the exam, each committee member had about 30 minutes to ask course-related questions.
            The courses included Dynamics of Structures, Statistical Mechanics, and Statistics in Network Science.
            Congrats!

        <p>On April 19, 2024, Sebin Oh gave a talk about <em>Fragility field for the regional PBEE analysis using R2D</em>.<br><br>
            This talk is the extension of the lightning talk that was given at the 2024 NHERI Computational Symposium (see <a href="news.html#nheri-symposium-2024">this post</a>). The need to develop a fragility field, a joint probability distribution as an extension of fragility curves, for the regional Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) framework was emphasized. Adopting the key concepts from statistical physics, the Ising model was introduced as a promising interpretable model for the fragility field. The demonstration of the Ising model as a fragility field was also presented. The presentation was recorded and uploaded to Youtude, which can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bcme4M_a17Y&list=PL2GxvrdFrBlmYq223gclSaVHzkq3NcCIM&index=3&ab_channel=NHERIDesignSafe-CIMedia">here</a>.

        <p>On February 1-2, 2024, Sebin Oh presented his research about <em>Fragility Field for the Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering on a Regional Scale</em>.<br><br>
            The presentation focused mainly on introduction of the Ising model from statistical mechanics to the field of regional seismic analysis, providing a promising remedy to the issues in developing a joint probability distribution for the damage states of structures while applying the Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) framework to a regional scale.<br><br>
