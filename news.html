        <p>On August 20, 2024, Sebin presented the recent work at the 2024 IFIP WG7.5 conference.<br><br>
            The 21st Working Conference of the IFIP Working Group (WG) 7.5 on Reliability and Optimization of Structural Systems was held at UC Berkeley, California, from August 19 to 21, including the technical tour to the Richmond Field Station at the last day.
            Sebin gave a 30-minute presentation on his study on "Long-range Ising Model for Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering at a Regional Scale" and introduced the idea of linking statistical physics to regional risk analysis, proposed in the recently published paper. 
            Whenever it is held, this working conference attracts many renowned researchers and professors in the field of structural and system reliability to discuss the current challenges and future directions.

        <p>On May 2, 2024, Sebin passed his PhD Qualifying Exam.<br><br>
            Sebin took his PhD Qualifying Exam and passed, and he advanced to a PhD Candidate.
            The examination committee included Prof. Matthew DeJong (Chair), Prof. Sanjay Govindjee, Prof. Kenichi Soga, and Prof. Marta Gonzalez.
            The Qualifying Exam was composed of 2 phases: (1) Research presentation and (2) Course-related Q&A.
            He gave a presentation about his PhD study titled <em>Multi-Scale Regional Risk Assessment of Civil Infrastructures Using Statistical Physics</em>. The presentation was about 30 minutes, followed by about 30 minutes of Q&A.
            In the second part of the exam, each committee member had about 30 minutes to ask course-related questions.
            The courses included Dynamics of Structures, Statistical Mechanics, and Statistics in Network Science.
            Congrats!

        <p>On April 19, 2024, Sebin gave a talk about <em>Fragility field for the regional PBEE analysis using R2D</em>.<br><br>
            This talk is the extension of the lightning talk that was given at the 2024 NHERI Computational Symposium (see <a href="news.html#nheri-symposium-2024">this post</a>). The need to develop a fragility field, a joint probability distribution as an extension of fragility curves, for the regional Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) framework was emphasized. Adopting the key concepts from statistical physics, the Ising model was introduced as a promising interpretable model for the fragility field. The demonstration of the Ising model as a fragility field was also presented. The presentation was recorded and uploaded to Youtude, which can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bcme4M_a17Y&list=PL2GxvrdFrBlmYq223gclSaVHzkq3NcCIM&index=3&ab_channel=NHERIDesignSafe-CIMedia">here</a>.
